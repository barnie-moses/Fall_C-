In the file For2While/main.cpp there is a working program that converts standard input to standard output. The exact purpose of the program isn’t important, however, you need to remove all uses of the for keyword from the program. There are test cases to confirm that the program’s behavior hasn’t changed as well as test cases to confirm that every use of the for keyword have been removed.

Write a program that reads trios of integers from the standard input stream until there are no more values. 

For each trio, print the smallest difference between the three. For example,
 if the three numbers are 1, 10, and 100, 
 the smallest difference is 9 (10 - 1), 
 as (100 - 1) and (100 - 10) are both larger than 9.


Example input:
1 10 100
7 14 7
900 899 876
8 764 10


Expected output:
The smallest diff of 1, 10, and 100 is 9.
The smallest diff of 7, 14, and 7 is 0.
The smallest diff of 900, 899, and 876 is 1.
The smallest diff of 8, 764, and 10 is 2.

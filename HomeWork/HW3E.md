Back in elementary school you likely learned your times tables, a table composed of all combinations of small numbers and their values when multiplied with each other. You need to write a program in TimesTable/main.cpp that takes in two pairs of integers that denote the ranges of the columns and the rows (inclusive).
Example input:
1 4
2 6
Expected output:
2*1=2, 2*2=4, 2*3=6, 2*4=8
3*1=3, 3*2=6, 3*3=9, 3*4=12
4*1=4, 4*2=8, 4*3=12, 4*4=16
5*1=5, 5*2=10, 5*3=15, 5*4=20
6*1=6, 6*2=12, 6*3=18, 6*4=24
